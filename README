A simple utility for reading and writing to and from EPP registers in an FPGA design based on
dpimref.vhd running on a Digilent Nexys2.

The project build assumes a directory structure like this:

src
|
+-apps
| |
| +-nexys2epp
|
+-libs
|
+-3rd

*** BUILDING ON LINUX ***

make -f Makefile.linux


*** USAGE ***

To write 0x00 to register 0:
    printf "\0" | ./nexys2epp -w -l1 -a0
To write 524288 zeros to register 3:
    cat /dev/zero | ./nexys2epp -w -l524288 -a3
To write the first 512 bytes from the file "sonic1.bin" to register 3:
    ./nexys2epp -w -fsonic1.bin -l512 -a3
To write all the data from the file "sonic1.bin" to register 3:
    ./nexys2epp -w -fsonic1.bin -a3
To read register 3 1024 times and write the result to out.bin:
    ./nexys2epp -r -l1024 -a3 -f out.bin
